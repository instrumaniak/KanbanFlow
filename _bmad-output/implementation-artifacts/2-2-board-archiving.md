# Story 2.2: Board Archiving

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a user,
I want to archive boards I'm not actively using,
so that my workspace stays clean without losing historical data.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** I am viewing a board, **When** I click "Archive Board", **Then** the board is hidden from the main project view, **And** a toast confirms "Board archived" with undo option
2. **Given** I want to see archived boards, **When** I click "Archived Boards" in the boards page or board settings, **Then** I see a list of all my archived boards (across all projects)
3. **Given** I want to restore an archived board, **When** I click "Restore" on an archived board, **Then** the board reappears in the main project view
4. **Given** I want to permanently delete an archived board, **When** I click "Delete Permanently" and confirm, **Then** the board and all data are permanently removed, **And** a confirmation dialog explains the irreversible action

## Dev Notes

### Board Entity Update

The Board entity (`backend/src/boards/entities/board.entity.ts`) requires a new column:
- `is_archived: boolean` — default `false`

### API Endpoints

**New endpoints for story 2.2:**
```
PATCH /api/boards/:id/archive    - Archive a board (set is_archived=true)
PATCH /api/boards/:id/restore  - Restore a board (set is_archived=false)
DELETE /api/boards/:id/permanent - Permanently delete archived board only
GET /api/boards?archived=true  - List archived boards

Modified:
GET /api/boards             - Update to exclude archived by default
```

### Frontend Components

**Files to create:**
- `frontend/src/features/boards/archived-boards.tsx` — Archived boards list page
- `frontend/src/features/boards/board-settings.tsx` — Add archive action to board settings
- Update: `frontend/src/features/boards/board-list.tsx` — Add "Archived Boards" button

### Previous Story Intelligence

**From Story 2.1 (Board CRUD):**
- Board entity has: id, name, background_color, user_id, project_id (nullable), created_at, updated_at
- Board CRUD complete with DELETE cascade to columns/cards (Story 1 handled this for projects)
- Authorization: User owns boards directly via user_id — all board operations verify board.user_id === session.userId
- 8 preset colors defined for board backgrounds

**Key insight from Story 2.1:**
- Board entity is at `backend/src/boards/entities/board.entity.ts`
- Boards module at `backend/src/boards/`
- Frontend feature at `frontend/src/features/boards/`
- API response format: `{ data: Board, message?: string }`
- Uses shadcn/ui components (never modify)

### Architecture Compliance

**Entity Pattern:**
```
Board {
  id: number
  name: string
  background_color: string
  user_id: number (NOT NULL)
  project_id: number | null
  is_archived: boolean (NEW - default false)
  created_at: Date
  updated_at: Date
}
```

**API Response Examples:**
```typescript
// PATCH /api/boards/:id/archive (200)
{
  data: { id: 1, name: "My Board", is_archived: true, ... },
  message: "Board archived"
}

// PATCH /api/boards/:id/restore (200)
{
  data: { id: 1, name: "My Board", is_archived: false, ... },
  message: "Board restored"
}

// DELETE /api/boards/:id/permanent (200)
{ message: "Board permanently deleted" }

// Error (400 - not archived)
{ statusCode: 400, message: "Board must be archived before permanent deletion", error: "Bad Request" }
```

**List archived boards:**
```typescript
// GET /api/boards?archived=true (200)
{
  data: [
    { id: 1, name: "Old Board", is_archived: true, ... },
    { id: 2, name: "Another Archived", is_archived: true, ... }
  ]
}
```

### Critical Anti-Patterns

- ❌ NEVER allow archive on already archived boards — return error or no-op
- ❌ NEVER allow permanent delete on non-archived boards — must check is_archived=true
- ❌ NEVER show archived boards in default list — always filter by is_archived unless ?archived=true
- ❌ NEVER delete columns/cards when archving — preserve all data for restore
- ❌ Never use soft-delete (deleted_at) — use explicit is_archived flag
- ❌ Never modify user_id or project_id when restoring — keep original values

### Toast Configuration

- Archive toast: "Board archived" with Undo button, 5 seconds
- Restore toast: "Board restored"
- Permanent delete toast: "Board deleted permanently" (no undo — warning)
