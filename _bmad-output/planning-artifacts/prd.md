# Product Requirements Document - trello-clone

**Author:** Raziur

## Executive Summary

**KanbanFlow** is a self-hosted kanban board application that serves as a lightweight, full-featured alternative to Trello. Built for personal productivity management, it provides unlimited boards organized under customizable projects, with full data ownership and zero subscription costs.

Users can create and manage multiple boards with customizable backgrounds, define flexible columns per board, and organize cards with color-coded labels, markdown descriptions, and checklist tracking. The system supports drag-and-drop card management, per-column sorting, and search/filter capabilities.

### What Makes This Special

- **Self-hosted sovereignty** — Your data stays on your server. No SaaS subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, complete privacy.
- **Unlimited flexibility** — Unlimited boards under projects, each with fully customizable columns to match any workflow.
- **Developer-ready** — Built with modern, deployable tech (React/Vite, NestJS, MySQL) that you control end-to-end.
- **Demo-ready** — Clean UX and polished enough to invite others to explore and create their own boards.
