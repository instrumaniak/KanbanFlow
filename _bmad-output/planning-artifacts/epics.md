## Epic 1: User Onboarding & Project Setup

Users can register, login, and create their first project with a board — the foundation that gets users productive immediately.

### Story 1.1: Project Initialization

As a developer,
I want to initialize the monorepo with Vite frontend and NestJS backend,
So that the project has a solid foundation with modern tooling.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a fresh project directory
**When** I run the initialization commands
**Then** a monorepo structure is created with `frontend/` and `backend/` directories
**And** frontend uses Vite with React TypeScript template
**And** backend uses NestJS CLI with TypeScript
**And** shared `.prettierrc` is configured at root
**And** `frontend/` has shadcn/ui initialized with Tailwind CSS
**And** both projects have `package.json` with correct dependencies
**And** `.gitignore` covers node_modules, dist, .env files

### Story 1.2: Database Schema Setup

As a developer,
I want the database schema initialized with TypeORM,
So that the application can persist user and project data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a MySQL database is available
**When** I configure the `.env` file with database credentials
**Then** the NestJS ConfigModule loads configuration with validation
**And** TypeORM connects to MySQL with `synchronize: false`
**And** a `data-source.ts` file exists for TypeORM CLI
**And** initial migration creates `users` and `projects` tables
**And** `users` table has: id, email, password, role, created_at, updated_at
**And** `projects` table has: id, name, user_id (FK), created_at, updated_at
**And** `npm run migration:run` executes successfully

### Story 1.3: User Registration

As a new user,
I want to register with my email and password,
So that I can create an account and start using KanbanFlow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the registration page
**When** I enter a valid email and password
**Then** my account is created and I am automatically logged in
**And** the password is hashed with bcrypt before storage
**And** a session cookie is set (httpOnly, SameSite)
**And** I am redirected to the projects page

**Given** I enter an email that already exists
**When** I submit the registration form
**Then** I see an error message "Email already registered"

**Given** registration is disabled by admin
**When** I try to access the registration page
**Then** I see a message "Registration is currently closed"

### Story 1.4: User Login/Logout

As a registered user,
I want to log in with my credentials and log out when done,
So that I can securely access my workspace.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the login page
**When** I enter valid email and password
**Then** I am authenticated and redirected to the projects page
**And** a session cookie is set

**Given** I am logged in
**When** I click the logout button
**Then** my session is cleared
**And** I am redirected to the login page

**Given** I enter invalid credentials
**When** I submit the login form
**Then** I see an error message "Invalid email or password"
**And** rate limiting prevents brute force attempts

### Story 1.5: Design System Foundation

As a developer,
I want the design system foundation implemented with CSS variables,
So that all components have consistent theming and dark mode support.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the frontend is initialized
**When** I configure the design system
**Then** CSS variables define the Soft Teal color palette (light and dark tokens)
**And** typography uses Inter/system-ui stack with defined scale
**And** spacing uses a 4px base unit scale
**And** dark mode is toggled via CSS class and respects `prefers-color-scheme`
**And** a `use-theme` hook provides theme state and toggle function

### Story 1.6: App Shell & Navigation

As a user,
I want a consistent app layout with navigation,
So that I can easily move between projects and boards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am logged in
**When** I view the application
**Then** I see a header with the app name and user menu
**And** I see a collapsible sidebar (240px expanded, 0px collapsed)
**And** the sidebar is collapsed by default
**And** the sidebar shows my projects list
**And** breadcrumbs show current location (Project > Board)
**And** clicking a project navigates to it
**And** React Router handles client-side navigation

### Story 1.7: Project CRUD

As a user,
I want to create, view, edit, and delete projects,
So that I can organize my boards into logical groups.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I am on the projects page
**When** I click "Create Project"
**Then** an inline form appears for project name
**And** submitting creates the project and adds it to my list

**Given** I have projects
**When** I view the projects page
**Then** I see all my projects listed with names
**And** each project shows its board count

**Given** I want to rename a project
**When** I click edit on a project
**Then** I can modify the name inline
**And** changes are saved on Enter or blur

**Given** I want to delete a project
**When** I click delete and confirm
**Then** the project and all its boards are deleted (cascade)
**And** a success toast appears with undo option (5 seconds)

### Story 1.8: Empty State & Toast System

As a user,
I want helpful empty states and notifications,
So that I know what to do next and get feedback on my actions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I have no projects
**When** I view the projects page
**Then** I see an empty state with illustration, "Start organizing" headline, and "Create your first project" CTA

**Given** I perform an action (create, update, delete)
**When** the action completes
**Then** a toast notification appears in the bottom-right
**And** success toasts auto-dismiss after 3 seconds
**And** error toasts require manual dismiss
**And** destructive actions show an "Undo" button for 5 seconds

### Story 1.9: CLI Superadmin Creation

As an administrator,
I want a CLI script to create the initial superadmin user,
So that I can set up admin access before opening registration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the application is deployed
**When** I run `npm run create-admin` with email and password arguments
**Then** a user with admin role is created in the database
**And** the script validates email format and password strength
**And** the script prevents duplicate admin creation
**And** success message confirms admin creation

**When** the filter results are empty
**Then** I see "No cards found" with a "Clear search" button

**And** I can click "Clear all" to reset all filters

### Story 5.3: Dark Mode

As a user,
I want dark mode that respects my system preference and can be toggled manually,
So that I can use the app comfortably in any lighting condition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**When** I view the app
**Then** I see the full layout with horizontal scrolling columns
**And** the sidebar is collapsible

**Given** I am on tablet (640-1023px)
**When** I view the app

**When** I view the app
**Then** I see a single column view
**And** I can swipe left/right to switch columns

**And** skeletons use gray shapes that approximate the content

**Given** I submit a form
**When** the request is processing

**And** the button text changes to "Saving..."

**Given** an operation fails
**When** an error occurs
**Then** a red toast appears with a friendly error message
**And** the toast requires manual dismiss
**And** the message is actionable (e.g., "Failed to save. Retry?")

**Given** I perform a drag-drop
**When** the move is in progress
**Then** no loading indicator appears (optimistic update)
**And** if the server request fails, a toast notifies me
