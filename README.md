## Backend setup

```bash
$ cd backend
```

First, make sure you have a MySQL database running and create a database for the application. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the database connection details.

Install the packages and run the backend:

```bash
$ npm install

# migrate db
$ npm run migration:run

# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

Run tests:

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Frontend setup

```bash
$ cd frontend
```

Install the packages and run the frontend:

```bash
$ npm install

# development
$ npm run dev

```

Run tests:

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

```

## Deployment

The backend will serve the frontend SPA/static files and the API.

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm run build:release
```

This will build the production-ready version of the both **frontend** and **backend** and output it to the `release` directory in a ready to zip structure. Just Deploy the contents of the `release` directory accordingly.

From the release folder:
```bash
touch .env # create a .env file with your environment variables
node migrate.js # run database migrations
node app.js # start the backend server
```

### cPanel Hosting

The process is same for a typical nodejs application deployment on a cPanel shared hosting- Setup domain and create a nodejs application. Create your MySQL database. Upload the release build zip file to your cPanel hosting & extract the contents to your nodejs application directory.  Create `.env` and update the database connection details there. Run db migrations from terminal and start the server from nodejs application manager.

## Acknowledgement

AI assisted development tools were *heavily* used for planning & development of this project. Special thanks to `opencode` for their generous free tier.
